              Did you know that you can make your own eco friendly ink and ink pens from materials you can find in nature?

              Nick Neddo refers to himself as the Organic Artist and has written a book by the same name. The Organic
              Artist by Nick Neddo is a pretty cool book and he shows you how to make ink pens (including a kind of
              marker), brushes, berry inks, paint from minerals (rocks), etc. It is an awesome book to read--and his
              website is interesting to.
