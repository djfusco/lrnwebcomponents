Curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels making bread on the bathrobe, you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me, and eats owners hair then claws head yet has closed eyes but still sees you for ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside yet spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole. Flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower stand in front of the computer screen. Annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good cough hairball, eat toilet paper freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting. Twitch tail in permanent irritation this human feeds me, i should be a god so i love cuddles found somthing move i bite it tail chill on the couch table attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim and destroy couch as revenge. Flop over really likes hummus. Scratch at door to be let outside, get let out then scratch at door immmediately after to be let back in.",
